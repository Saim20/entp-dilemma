# The Hiring Dilemma at Shah-Shuja Group: Trust or Competence?

On a humid morning in July 2018, Md Shujauddawla sat in his newly rented office space in Dhaka's Tejgaon Industrial Area, staring at a list of names scribbled on a notepad. The 38-year-old entrepreneur had just resigned from his comfortable position as a divisional manager at PRAN-RFL Group, one of Bangladesh's largest conglomerates, to establish his own venture in the home appliance sector. His company, Shah-Shuja Group, had secured its first shipment of gas stove components from a Chinese manufacturer, and the goods were expected to clear customs within a week. But he faced a critical decision that would shape the future of his enterprise: Who should he hire to help him build this business?

The decision was not merely about filling positions. It was about choosing between two fundamentally different recruitment philosophies. On one side of his notepad were names of friends and relatives—people he had known for years, individuals he could trust implicitly. On the other side were placeholder titles: "Experienced Warehouse Manager," "Sales Professional with 5+ years," "Quality Control Specialist." These represented strangers from the open job market—professionals with proven skills but no personal connection to him.

As he looked at the clock ticking toward his first supplier meeting, Shujauddawla knew this decision could not wait. The question that consumed him was stark and unavoidable: Should he build his founding team from his trusted social circle or hire competent professionals from the open market? The choice would determine not just the operational efficiency of Shah-Shuja Group, but its entire organizational culture and capacity for growth.

# The Protagonist: A Corporate Veteran Turned Entrepreneur

Md Shujauddawla's journey to entrepreneurship was shaped by a decade of corporate experience that had both equipped and constrained him. Born in 1980 in a middle-class family in Dhaka, he had graduated from the University of Dhaka with a degree in Business Administration in 2002. His career began modestly, but by 2008, he had secured a position at PRAN-RFL Group, a diversified conglomerate that had become synonymous with Bangladeshi manufacturing success.

PRAN-RFL Group, established in 1981, had grown into one of the largest business houses in Bangladesh by the 2010s, with operations spanning food processing, plastics, and consumer goods. The company employed thousands of workers across multiple factories and maintained an extensive distribution network reaching even the remotest corners of the country. For Shujauddawla, working at PRAN-RFL was more than just a job—it was an education in how large-scale operations functioned.

During his tenure from 2008 to 2018, Shujauddawla rose through the ranks to become a divisional manager overseeing supply chain operations for the home appliance division. His responsibilities included managing relationships with international suppliers, primarily from China and Thailand, coordinating customs clearance procedures, overseeing warehouse operations, and ensuring timely distribution to retailers across Bangladesh. The position paid him a respectable monthly salary of BDT 85,000 (approximately USD 1,000), and came with benefits including health insurance, performance bonuses, and the prestige of working for a nationally recognized brand.

But beneath the surface of professional success, Shujauddawla harbored entrepreneurial ambitions. During his decade at PRAN-RFL, he had observed the explosive growth of Bangladesh's middle class and their increasing demand for modern kitchen appliances. He noticed that while refrigerators and televisions were becoming common household items, the market for quality gas and electric stoves remained fragmented and dominated by low-quality imports. He saw an opportunity.

"I spent ten years watching how the business worked from the inside," Shujauddawla later recalled in an interview. "I learned everything—how to source products from China, how to navigate the bureaucracy at Chittagong Port, how to manage inventory, how to build distribution channels. But I also saw the limitations of working in a large corporate structure. Every decision required multiple approvals. Innovation was slow. I felt I could move faster on my own."

The decision to leave PRAN-RFL was not made lightly. Shujauddawla had a wife and two young children to support. The steady corporate salary provided security, and walking away from it meant risking everything. However, by early 2018, he had saved approximately BDT 2.5 million (about USD 30,000) and secured an additional BDT 1.5 million in loans from family members. With this capital, he believed he could establish a foothold in the home appliance market.

# The Industry Landscape and Market Opportunity

The Bangladesh home appliance market in 2018 was experiencing significant transformation. The country's GDP had been growing at an average rate of 6-7% annually since 2010, and this economic expansion was creating a burgeoning middle class with disposable income. According to market research reports, the home appliance sector was projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 15-20% over the next five years.

The gas stove segment, in particular, represented an interesting opportunity. Natural gas was available in most urban and many semi-urban areas of Bangladesh through a network managed by government-owned utilities. Nearly 80% of urban households in Dhaka, Chittagong, and other major cities had piped gas connections by 2018, making gas stoves the preferred cooking solution for middle-class families. However, the market was flooded with cheap, low-quality Chinese imports that often had safety issues, poor build quality, and short lifespans.

Shujauddawla's research revealed several key insights about the market:

First, there was a clear gap between the ultra-cheap segment (stoves priced below BDT 1,500 or about USD 18) and the premium imported brands (priced above BDT 8,000 or about USD 95). The middle segment—quality products at affordable prices—was underserved.

Second, consumers were becoming more quality-conscious and safety-aware. Several widely reported incidents of gas leaks and fires caused by faulty stoves had made consumers more willing to pay a premium for reliable products.

Third, the retail distribution channel was evolving. Traditional small shops were being complemented by modern retail chains and appliance showrooms, particularly in urban areas. These new retail formats demanded suppliers who could provide consistent quality, after-sales service, and proper documentation.

Fourth, import regulations favored local assembly and manufacturing. The government was encouraging import substitution through various policy incentives, including reduced corporate tax rates for manufacturing enterprises and higher import duties on finished goods compared to components.

Shujauddawla's business model for Shah-Shuja Group was designed to exploit these market dynamics. The plan was to import high-quality gas stove components and burner assemblies from established Chinese manufacturers, perform final assembly and quality control locally in Bangladesh, and position the products in the BDT 2,500-5,000 price range. The brand promise would be "Chinese quality at Bangladeshi prices"—essentially offering reliability and safety at an affordable cost.

The company registered as "Shah-Shuja Group" in March 2018, describing its business as "Importer & Manufacturer of Auto Gas Stove & Electric Stove And Home Appliance." Shujauddawla rented a 3,000-square-foot facility in Tejgaon Industrial Area, one of Dhaka's established manufacturing zones, which would serve as both warehouse and assembly workshop. He negotiated contracts with two Chinese suppliers in Guangdong Province for stove components and placed his first order worth USD 25,000.

By July 2018, everything was theoretically in place. The first shipment was en route to Chittagong Port, initial discussions with three retail chains had shown promising interest, and the business licenses were in order. There was only one critical piece missing: the team to actually run the operations.

# The Immediate Operational Requirements

As Shujauddawla mapped out the operational workflow for Shah-Shuja Group, he identified several critical functions that required immediate staffing:

**Customs and Logistics Coordination**: Someone needed to manage the customs clearance process at Chittagong Port, coordinate with shipping agents and clearing houses, arrange transportation to the Dhaka facility, and handle all import documentation. This role required familiarity with Bangladesh customs procedures, the ability to navigate bureaucratic requirements, and skills in negotiating with logistics service providers. Mistakes in this function could result in shipments being held up for weeks, demurrage charges, or even confiscation of goods.

**Warehouse Management**: The facility needed someone to receive incoming shipments, organize inventory systematically, maintain accurate stock records, implement security measures to prevent theft, and coordinate the flow of materials to the assembly line. Given that each shipment represented tens of thousands of dollars worth of components, security and accountability were paramount concerns.

**Assembly and Quality Control**: The actual assembly of gas stoves from imported components required some technical skill, though not at a highly specialized level. However, quality control was critical. Each stove needed to be tested for gas leaks, burner performance, and safety features before being sent to retailers. Defective products reaching customers could destroy the brand's reputation and expose the company to legal liability.

**Sales and Distribution**: Someone needed to build and maintain relationships with retail chains and appliance showrooms, process orders, coordinate deliveries, and handle after-sales issues. This role required strong communication skills, persistence, and the ability to negotiate terms with retail buyers.

**Financial Management and Administration**: Basic accounting, payment processing, payroll management, and administrative coordination were essential. While Shujauddawla could handle strategic financial decisions himself, the day-to-day bookkeeping and administrative tasks required dedicated attention.

Shujauddawla estimated he needed to hire at least five people immediately to cover these functions, with plans to expand to ten employees within the first year if sales met projections. The question was: What hiring strategy should he employ?

# The Trust-Based Model: Drawing from Personal Networks

As Shujauddawla reviewed his list of potential hires from his personal network, the appeal of this approach was strong. His circle included several individuals who seemed suitable:

His cousin, Rashid, was unemployed after completing a bachelor's degree in literature. Though Rashid had no business experience, Shujauddawla had known him since childhood. They had grown up in the same neighborhood, attended the same schools, and maintained close contact throughout their lives. Rashid needed a job, and Shujauddawla needed someone he could trust for warehouse management. The family connection seemed to guarantee loyalty.

A childhood friend, Kamal, had worked in various sales positions for small trading companies. While his track record was mediocre—he had changed jobs four times in six years—the two had been inseparable as teenagers, and Shujauddawla felt confident that their personal bond would translate into dedication and effort. Kamal seemed like a natural choice for the sales role.

Shujauddawla's brother-in-law, Farhan, had experience working at a logistics company, though in a junior administrative position rather than anything related to customs clearance. However, Farhan was family, he was hardworking, and he had expressed strong interest in joining the venture. The family connection would ensure he remained committed even during difficult times.

Two of Shujauddawla's former university classmates had also expressed interest when he mentioned his plans. Neither had directly relevant experience—one had been working in the textile industry, the other in a bank—but they were educated, trustworthy, and enthusiastic about being part of a startup.

The advantages of hiring from this personal network were compelling:

**The Trust Premium**: In the import and manufacturing business, inventory represents cash sitting in physical form. Shujauddawla was acutely aware of the risk of employee theft, which he had witnessed during his time at PRAN-RFL. Components could easily "walk out" of the warehouse, cash payments from retailers could be pocketed, and quality control could be faked. Hiring people with whom he had deep personal relationships provided a layer of security that no background check could offer. He believed that friends and family would never steal from him because betraying the business would mean betraying their personal relationship.

**Rapid Recruitment**: The formal hiring process would take time that Shujauddawla did not have. He would need to draft job descriptions, post advertisements on job portals, screen potentially hundreds of resumes, conduct multiple rounds of interviews, and check references. This entire process could take two to three months. With his first shipment arriving within a week, he could not afford such delays. His personal network offered an immediate solution—he could make a phone call, have a conversation over tea, and finalize arrangements within days.

**Lower Initial Salary Expectations**: People from his social circle were willing to join at lower starting salaries than experienced market professionals would demand. Rashid, being unemployed, was willing to accept BDT 18,000 per month—significantly less than the BDT 30,000 that an experienced warehouse manager would command. This meant Shujauddawla could conserve his limited startup capital.

**Emotional and Psychological Support**: Starting a business is a lonely and stressful journey. Having "his own people" around him would create a familial atmosphere at the workplace. These were individuals who would celebrate successes with genuine happiness and provide emotional support during setbacks. The psychological comfort of working alongside friends and family was not a trivial consideration.

**Flexibility and Sacrifice**: Shujauddawla believed that friends and family would be more willing to go the extra mile during the startup phase. They would not watch the clock or complain about occasional weekend work. They would understand that the company's survival might require temporary sacrifices, and they would share in the vision of building something together.

Shujauddawla remembered conversations with other small business owners in Bangladesh who had hired from their personal networks. Many spoke positively about the experience: "When you're starting out, you need people who will stand with you no matter what," one entrepreneur had told him. "A stranger will leave the moment they get a better offer. But family stays."

# The Competence-Based Model: Hiring from the Open Market

Despite the appealing aspects of hiring from his personal network, Shujauddawla was deeply familiar with corporate standards from his time at PRAN-RFL. The company had a professional HR department, standardized hiring procedures, and clear performance metrics. This background made him acutely aware of what hiring from the open market could offer:

**Objective Accountability and Professional Distance**: A professional employee hired from the open market enters with a clear understanding of the employment relationship. They know their job description, their performance targets, and the consequences of not meeting expectations. Most importantly, there is no personal relationship complicating the manager-subordinate dynamic. If an employee underperforms, they can be given direct feedback, put on a performance improvement plan, or ultimately terminated—all without the emotional burden of damaging a personal relationship. Shujauddawla understood that maintaining professional distance was not about being cold or impersonal; it was a functional necessity for maintaining standards and accountability.

**Specialized Skills and Proven Track Records**: The open market offered access to individuals with specific expertise relevant to Shah-Shuja Group's operations. For warehouse management, Shujauddawla could hire someone who had managed inventory systems, understood proper storage protocols, and had experience with stock management software. For customs clearance, he could find someone who had worked specifically in import operations, knew the documentation requirements, and had established relationships with clearing agents and customs officials. For sales, he could recruit someone who had already built relationships with retail chains and understood the dynamics of appliance distribution.

These specialized skills were not merely nice-to-have advantages—they could make the difference between smooth operations and costly mistakes. A single error in customs documentation could delay a shipment for weeks and incur thousands of dollars in demurrage charges. Poor warehouse organization could lead to inventory losses or damage. Ineffective sales could mean the business failed to gain market traction during the crucial early months.

**Scalability and Systematic Growth**: Shujauddawla's vision for Shah-Shuja Group extended beyond a small family operation. He wanted to build a company that could eventually compete with established players in the market. This required building systems and processes, not just relying on personal relationships. Hiring professionals would establish precedents and standards that could be replicated as the company grew. It would create a culture of professionalism from day one.

A personal network is finite. Shujauddawla knew only so many people he could trust. If the initial hires from his network did not work out, he would quickly exhaust his options. But the open market was virtually limitless—if one hire did not succeed, he could always recruit another professional.

**Reduced Complexity of Personal Relationships**: Mixing business with personal relationships creates complications that extend beyond the workplace. If a friend or family member underperformed or needed to be terminated, it could create tension at family gatherings, damage friendships, and force other relatives or friends to take sides. The business decision would have repercussions in Shujauddawla's personal life for years to come. Professional employees, by contrast, could be managed purely on business terms without affecting personal relationships.

**Professional Growth and Knowledge Transfer**: Hiring experienced professionals would bring fresh perspectives and knowledge that Shujauddawla himself might not possess. Someone who had worked in the appliance industry at a different company could share insights about market trends, customer preferences, or operational efficiencies. This knowledge transfer could accelerate Shah-Shuja Group's learning curve and help avoid common pitfalls.

Shujauddawla had discussed the hiring dilemma with a former colleague from PRAN-RFL who had also started his own business. This colleague had emphatically advocated for professional hiring: "The moment I hired my first real professional—someone I found through a headhunter—everything changed," he had said. "This person brought systems, discipline, and expertise that none of my family members could provide. Yes, it cost more, but the productivity gains were worth it."

# The Underlying Tensions and Trade-offs

As Shujauddawla wrestled with the decision, he recognized that he was navigating a fundamental trade-off between trust and competence, loyalty and skill, psychological comfort and professional efficiency.

The trust-based model maximized reliability and loyalty but risked compromising on professional standards and operational efficiency. It provided emotional comfort but potentially at the expense of business performance. It was cost-effective in the short term but might create limitations for future growth.

The competence-based model maximized professional capability and scalability but introduced risks related to trustworthiness and loyalty. It established professional standards from the beginning but created a more formal, less personal work environment. It was more expensive initially but potentially offered better returns on investment through higher productivity.

Neither option was inherently superior—each represented a different set of priorities and assumptions about what mattered most in the early stages of the business.

Shujauddawla also considered hybrid approaches. Perhaps he could hire friends and family for some positions while recruiting professionals for others. For example, he could hire a professional customs clearance specialist and warehouse manager—roles requiring specific expertise—while bringing in trusted friends for sales and administrative positions. Or he could hire from his network initially but provide extensive training to professionalize them over time.

However, hybrid approaches carried their own risks. A mixed workforce might create a two-tier culture where family members felt entitled to special treatment while professional hires resented the favoritism. It could undermine the meritocratic culture he hoped to build.

Time was running out. The shipment from China was scheduled to arrive at Chittagong Port in five days. Without staff in place to handle customs clearance and warehouse operations, the entire venture could stall before it even began.

# The Decision

After several sleepless nights and conversations with his wife, Shujauddawla made his choice. He decided to prioritize trust and loyalty over professional credentials. He believed that in the early, vulnerable stage of Shah-Shuja Group, having people he could "count on" was more important than having highly skilled professionals who might lack commitment to the venture's success.

He contacted Rashid, Kamal, Farhan, and two university classmates. Within a week, all five had agreed to join Shah-Shuja Group. Rashid would handle warehouse management, Kamal would manage sales and retail relationships, Farhan would coordinate customs and logistics, and the two classmates would handle assembly/quality control and administration respectively.

Shujauddawla felt relieved. The team was in place. The people around him were individuals he had known for years, people who shared his excitement about building something new. The office atmosphere was friendly, almost festive. There was laughter, informal communication, and a sense of shared adventure.

The first few weeks seemed to validate his decision. The customs clearance went smoothly—Farhan, though inexperienced, worked long hours and successfully navigated the process with help from clearing agents. The warehouse was set up, components were organized, and assembly operations began. The initial batch of 200 gas stoves was assembled and delivered to a retail chain that had placed a trial order.

Shah-Shuja Group was operational.

# The Emergence of Challenges

However, within three months, cracks began to appear in the trust-based hiring model. The friendly, informal atmosphere that Shujauddawla had initially cherished started to reveal its operational costs.

The first significant issue emerged in warehouse management. Rashid, despite his loyalty, had no systematic approach to inventory control. Components were stored haphazardly, making it difficult to locate specific items quickly. Stock records were maintained inconsistently—some entries were recorded in a physical notebook, others in an Excel spreadsheet, and some not recorded at all. When Shujauddawla asked for an inventory count before placing the second order with Chinese suppliers, Rashid took three full days to compile the report, and even then, the numbers did not fully reconcile with purchase records.

More troubling, some components seemed to be missing. Nothing dramatic—a few dozen burner valves here, some glass panels there—but the pattern suggested either poor record-keeping or actual theft. When Shujauddawla raised the issue with Rashid, his cousin became defensive: "Are you accusing me of stealing? I've been working day and night for this company, and this is how you treat family?"

The conversation was painful. Shujauddawla was not accusing Rashid of theft—he genuinely did not know if the discrepancies were due to poor record-keeping or actual pilferage. But the very fact that Rashid framed the conversation as a personal attack rather than a professional performance issue highlighted the problem. The familial relationship made it nearly impossible to maintain objective accountability.

Similar patterns emerged in other areas. Kamal, handling sales, was enthusiastic but lacked systematic follow-through. He would have great initial conversations with retail buyers but often failed to follow up on commitments, missed deadlines for submitting quotations, and did not maintain organized records of customer interactions. When sales targets were missed, Kamal attributed it to "market conditions" and became hurt when Shujauddawla suggested more structured sales processes.

"Why are you trying to turn this into a corporate environment?" Kamal complained. "I thought we were building something different here, something more flexible and human. You're starting to sound like the bosses at PRAN-RFL."

The quality control problems were perhaps most concerning. Several retailers reported receiving stoves with loose fittings, burners that did not ignite properly, or minor cosmetic defects. These were not catastrophic failures, but they damaged Shah-Shuja Group's reputation and led to returns and replacements that hurt profitability. When Shujauddawla tried to implement a more rigorous quality inspection process, the employee responsible—one of his university classmates—felt micromanaged and questioned why Shujauddawla did not trust him.

The core issue was consistent across all these situations: the personal relationships made it extremely difficult to establish and enforce professional standards. Any attempt to provide critical feedback or implement stricter processes was interpreted as a personal judgment on the individual's character or loyalty rather than an objective assessment of work performance.

# The Erosion of Boundaries

The blurring of personal and professional boundaries created other complications. Rashid began taking extended lunch breaks to attend to family matters, assuming that his cousin would understand. When payday arrived, Kamal asked for an advance on the next month's salary to cover a personal expense, putting Shujauddawla in an awkward position—refusing would seem heartless, but agreeing would set a problematic precedent.

Family gatherings became uncomfortable. At a wedding celebration, relatives commented on how generous Shujauddawla was being in "taking care of" Rashid and Farhan, framing their employment as an act of charity rather than a business transaction. Rashid's mother, Shujauddawla's aunt, privately asked him to "go easy" on her son because Rashid was trying his best.

The workplace culture that Shujauddawla had envisioned—professional yet humane, efficient yet supportive—was not materializing. Instead, he had created an environment where personal relationships trumped professional accountability, where performance expectations were ambiguous and unenforceable, where employees felt entitled to flexibility and forgiveness based on their social connection to the founder rather than their contributions to the business.

By the six-month mark, Shah-Shuja Group was underperforming. Sales were below projections, operational costs were higher than budgeted due to inefficiencies and quality control failures, and Shujauddawla found himself working sixteen-hour days to compensate for gaps in his team's performance. He was doing warehouse inventory himself, personally checking every stove before it left for delivery, and often handling customer service issues because he could not rely on his team's professionalism.

The irony was stark: he had hired friends and family to make his life easier and the startup phase less stressful, but the result was the opposite. He was more stressed than ever, carrying the operational burden while also managing the emotional complexity of working with people he could not criticize without damaging personal relationships.

# A Moment of Reckoning

In December 2018, six months after launch, Shujauddawla sat once again in his office, reviewing the company's financial statements. Shah-Shuja Group had generated revenue of BDT 1.8 million, but after accounting for the cost of goods, operational expenses, and salaries, the company had a net loss of BDT 400,000. At this rate, his personal savings would be depleted within another six months.

A retail chain that had been one of his most promising initial customers had just informed him that they would not be placing additional orders due to quality concerns. Another retailer was demanding a discount to compensate for the higher-than-expected return rate on Shah-Shuja stoves.

Shujauddawla knew he faced another critical decision point. He could continue with his current team, hoping that with more time and training, they would improve their performance. He could try to have difficult conversations about performance standards, risking damage to personal relationships but attempting to establish clearer expectations. Or he could start replacing some of his friends and family with professional hires, which would be emotionally painful but might save the business.

The question that now consumed him was different from the one he had faced in July: Was it possible to correct course from a trust-based hiring strategy, or had his initial decision locked him into a trajectory that was difficult to escape?

As the December sun set over Dhaka, Shujauddawla pondered not just the fate of Shah-Shuja Group, but the broader lesson about entrepreneurial decision-making in contexts where social relationships and business requirements exist in tension. What should an entrepreneur do when the very trust that was meant to provide security becomes a barrier to accountability and growth?
